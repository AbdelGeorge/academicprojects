# ABDEL SINI GEORGE'S PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a analytics student with a strong interest in data and business analytics. Below, you'll find a selection of projects I've worked on. Feel free to explore, collaborate, or reach out if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration.

## About Me

I'm a junior marketing analyst with a focus on formulating strategy for marketing campaigns. I love to learn and experiment with new technologies, and I'm dedicated to writing clean and maintainable code.

## Projects

### Project 1: ANALYSIS OF COVID 19 DEATH CASES
- Description: The goal of the project is to create a model that can inform the relevant authorities about death cases associated to covid in order to reduce the effects of 
  the epidemic and allocate resources as effectively as possible.
- Repository: [Project 1 Repository](https://github.com/AbdelGeorge/academicprojects/blob/2bf8eafaedba0583d1e97ee0266533a16573fb25/Covid%20Death_Prediction%20-%20Linear%20Regression.str)
- Project Doc: [Report 1](https://github.com/AbdelGeorge/academicprojects/blob/2bf8eafaedba0583d1e97ee0266533a16573fb25/Covid%20Death%20Prediction%20Report.pdf)
- Technologies: IBM SPSS Modeller

### Project 2: A MODEL FOR PREDICTING THE RISK OF LATE DELIVERY USING A NEURAL NETWORK
- Description: Using the order input parameters as a basis, the artificial neural network (ANN) model successfully predicts the delivery risk.
- Repository: [Project 2 Repository](https://github.com/AbdelGeorge/academicprojects/blob/2bf8eafaedba0583d1e97ee0266533a16573fb25/LATE%20DELIVERY%20RISK%20PREDICTION%20MODEL%20USING%20NEURAL%20NETWORK.ipynb)
- Project Doc: [Report 2](https://github.com/AbdelGeorge/academicprojects/blob/2bf8eafaedba0583d1e97ee0266533a16573fb25/LATE%20DELIVERY%20RISK%20PREDICTION%20MODEL%20USING%20NEURAL%20NETWORK%20REPORT.pdf)
- Technologies: Python, Artifical Neural Network

### Project 3: LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL FOR RUSSIAN HOUSING PRICE PREDICTION
- Description: The goal of the project is to precisely forecast the price of a home based on previous home sales data, which will help to remove any doubt surrounding home 
  prices and raise customer understanding of the home's genuine market value.
- Repository: [Project 3 Repository](https://github.com/AbdelGeorge/academicprojects/blob/2bf8eafaedba0583d1e97ee0266533a16573fb25/RUSSIAN%20HOUSING%20PRICE%20PREDICTION.ipynb)
- Project Doc: [Report 3](https://github.com/AbdelGeorge/academicprojects/blob/2bf8eafaedba0583d1e97ee0266533a16573fb25/RUSSIAN%20HOUSING%20PRICE%20PREDICTION%20REPORT.pdf)
- Technologies: Python, Linear Regression Model
