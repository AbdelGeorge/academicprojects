# ABDEL SINI GEORGE'S PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a analytics student with a strong interest in data and business analytics. Below, you'll find a selection of projects I've worked on. Feel free to explore, collaborate, or reach out if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration.

## About Me

I'm a junior marketing analyst with a focus on formulating strategy for marketing campaigns. I love to learn and experiment with new technologies, and I'm dedicated to writing clean and maintainable code.

## Projects

### Project 1: ANALYSIS OF COVID 19 DEATH CASES
- Description: The goal of the project is to create a model that can inform the relevant authorities about death cases associated to covid in order to reduce the effects of 
  the epidemic and allocate resources as effectively as possible.
- Repository: [Project 1 Repository](https://github.com/AbdelGeorge/academicprojects/blob/2bf8eafaedba0583d1e97ee0266533a16573fb25/Covid%20Death_Prediction%20-%20Linear%20Regression.str)
- Project Doc: [Report 1](https://github.com/AbdelGeorge/academicprojects/blob/2bf8eafaedba0583d1e97ee0266533a16573fb25/Covid%20Death%20Prediction%20Report.pdf)
- Technologies: IBM SPSS Modeller

### Project 2: A MODEL FOR PREDICTING THE RISK OF LATE DELIVERY USING A NEURAL NETWORK
- Description: Using the order input parameters as a basis, the artificial neural network (ANN) model successfully predicts the delivery risk.
- Repository: [Project 2 Repository](https://github.com/AbdelGeorge/academicprojects/blob/2bf8eafaedba0583d1e97ee0266533a16573fb25/LATE%20DELIVERY%20RISK%20PREDICTION%20MODEL%20USING%20NEURAL%20NETWORK.ipynb)

- Technologies: Python, Artifical Neural Network

### Project 3: LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL FOR RUSSIAN HOUSING PRICE PREDICTION
- Description: The goal of the project is to precisely forecast the price of a home based on previous home sales data, which will help to remove any doubt surrounding home 
  prices and raise customer understanding of the home's genuine market value.

- Project Doc: [Report 3](https://github.com/AbdelGeorge/academicprojects/blob/2bf8eafaedba0583d1e97ee0266533a16573fb25/RUSSIAN%20HOUSING%20PRICE%20PREDICTION%20REPORT.pdf)
- Technologies: Python, Linear Regression Model

### Project 4: SALES ANALYSIS OF E-COMMERCE COMPANY USING VISUAL DASHBOARDS 
- Description: The project aimed to create a comprehensive visual dashboard for analyzing the sales data of an e-commerce company, providing insights into trends and sales statistics across different product categories over a 3-year period. The objective included monitoring real-time sales performance through dynamically determined sales and budget-specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
*Conducted data preprocessing and transformation using SQL queries, focusing on Joins and Aggregation techniques.
*Implemented data cleaning procedures, handling null values through SQL ISNULL function, and performed data encoding using SQL Case expressions.
*Executed Data modeling and designed a star schema, establishing relationships between fact and dimension tables using Power BI.
*Developed an interactive visual dashboard featuring slicer options for effective segmentation analysis across various sales segments, all within Power BI.
*Created a dynamic visualization tool to evaluate key sales metrics based on budget and sales variables, enabling real-time monitoring of sales performance.
